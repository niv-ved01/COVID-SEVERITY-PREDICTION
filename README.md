# Predicting Severe COVID-19 Cases in Unvaccinated Patients
# Research Overview

During the peak months of August to October 2022, Auckland General Hospital operated at 95% capacity due to an influx of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. The Hospital Board is concerned about the severity of symptoms that extend patients’ stays.

This research aims to analyze the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms and propose a predictive model for severe cases. The factors considered include patient weight, age, duration since testing positive, presence of diabetes, and sex.

## Research Structure

1. **Statistical Analysis**: 
   - This section provides a detailed descriptive analysis, focusing on objectives such as comparing weights between females and males, and evaluating 'weight' and 'age' as predictors of 'duration' using Frequentist and Probabilistic approaches.

2. **Main Analysis**: 
   - This section addresses the Hospital Board’s primary concern of predicting severe COVID-19 symptoms in unvaccinated patients using Logistic models, Quantile regression, and Generalized Additive Models.

3. **Evaluation of ROC Curves**: 
   - This section examines the limitations of ROC curves in evaluating model performance.

4. **Expected Severe COVID-19 Cases**: 
   - This section forecasts severe COVID-19 cases using a separate dataset, discussing a predictive model and its assumptions.

## Research Outcomes

The results of this research aim to provide insights for the Hospital Board to allocate resources more effectively in managing severe COVID-19 cases.
